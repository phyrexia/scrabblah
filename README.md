Scrabblah, a Scrabble Clone - UAB CIS496 Games & Puzzles Seminar, & BEYOND!!@

Scrabblah is written in Java 7 with some help from IntelliJ IDEA.  It is, as of
this writing, a continuing work in progress.  I have lofty goals for this project
and I look forward to its continued development.  Among these goal is for this engine to
communicate with a variety of different front-ends.   The plan is to achieved this via
command-line piping.  I would also like to build an interface with other Scr*bble front-ends
to test various aspects of the program (for example, playing aginst someone in FaceBook Scrabble.

Work on Scrabblah began in August 2013 under the advisement of Dr. Kenneth Sloan,
Associate Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
